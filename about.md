The Cyber4Paleo Community Development Workshop
--------------------------------------------------

The Cyber4Paleo Community Development Workshop -- June 20th-21st, 2016 at NCAR (the National Center for Atmospheric Research), Boulder CO -- is intended to provide an opportunity for users and developers within the paleo-bio-geosciences to learn and work together to investigate and develop new uses, end products or links between existing data resources.  

Cyber4Paleo Workshop Goals
--------------------------------------------------

The specific goals for the C4P-CDE are:

1.  Provide an opportunity for individuals to learn about specific geoscientific resources;
2.  Provide a forum for users to discuss use cases and scenarios with project teams, and begin developing new ideas or tools in a supportive environment;
3.  Create space for hands-on working time for individuals interested in building resources that help span PBDB, Neotoma, and allied cyberinfrastructure resources including SESAR, NOAA Paleo, Open Core Data, LiPD, DarwinCore, VertNet, STEPPE, and/or iDigPaleo;
4. Engage early career scientists and other scientific users with these resources and give them time to explore and develop research applications;
5. Provide a forum for informal conversations and learning opportunities among scientific users, project teams, and developers;
6. Develop tools to facilitate the long-term care and accessibility of data and samples (in compliance with emerging publisher's and granting agency policies) such as the submission of data to trusted repositories and IGSN registration.
