Collaboration and Cyberinfrastructure for Paleogeosciences (C4P) is a Research Coordination Network (RCN) funded by the EarthCube initiative within the National Science Foundation.  C4P focuses on the development and deployment of standards for aggregation and dissemination of paleogeoscience data, with the goal of facilitating research focused on the ecology and evolution of life through time. Increasing accessibility to “dark data” and hidden data and specimen collections are important goals of this project. To learn more, please see the [C4P website](http://earthcube.org/group/c4p).
