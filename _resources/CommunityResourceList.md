## Geoscientific Resources

Please see this <a href="http://bit.ly/1r4AqLN">EarthCube Tools presentation</a>, which provides an overview of many resources, some of which will be relevant to the C4P Community Development Workshop.

### Continental Scientific Drilling Coordination Office (CSDCO)

* <b>Description:</b> The CSDCO provides infrastructure for scientists utilizing core samples from Earth&rsquo;s continents in their research, through integrated support for coring and drilling projects, from project inception through curation.
* <b>URL:</b> <a>http://csdco.org</a>

### DarwinCore

* <b>Description:</b> The Darwin Core is body of standards that facilitate the sharing of information about biological diversity by providing reference definitions, examples, and commentaries. The Darwin Core is primarily based on taxa, their occurrence in nature as documented by observations, specimens, samples, and related information.

### Flyover Country

* <b>Description:</b> Exposes EarthCube resources on mobile devices for offline use in outreach and soon research purposes. Flyover Country&trade; is a National Science Foundation funded offline mobile app for geoscience outreach and data discovery. The app exposes interactive geologic maps from Macrostrat.org, fossil localities from Neotomadb.org and Paleobiodb.org, core sample localities from LacCore.org, Wikipedia articles, offline base maps, and the user&rsquo;s current GPS determined location, altitude, speed, and heading. The app analyzes a given flight path and caches relevant map data and points of interest (POI), and displays these data during the flight, without in flight wifi. By downloading only the data relevant to a particular flightpath, cache sizes remain reasonable, allowing for a robust experience without an internet connection.

### IGSN

* <b>Description:</b> IGSN stands for International Geo Sample Number. The IGSN is an alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies samples taken from our natural environment (for example: rock specimens, water samples, sediment cores) as well as related sampling features (sites, stations, stratigraphic sections, etc.).  The IGSN Central Catalog (in development) aggregates metadata from all IGSN Allocating Agents worldwide (SESAR, GA, CSIRO, MARUM, GFZ, etc) and publishes the result as Linked Data.

### Index to Marine and Lacustrine Geological Samples (IMLGS)

* <b>Description:</b> The IMLGS helps scientists locate and obtain geologic material from sea floor and lakebed cores, grabs, and dredges archived by participating institutions around the world. Data include basic collection and storage information, as well as lithology, texture, age, principal investigator, province, weathering, metamorphism, glass remarks, and descriptive data for some samples, at the discretion of the curator, and links to view and download related data and images. The Curators' Consortium guides the database, maintained on behalf of the group by NOAA since 1977.

### Paleobiology Database (PBDB)

* <b>Description:</b> The Paleobiology Database (PaleoBioDB) is a non-governmental, non-profit public resource for paleontological data. It has been organized and operated by a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional, international group of paleobiological researchers. Its purpose is to provide global, collection-based occurrence and taxonomic data for organisms of all geological ages, as well data services to allow easy access to data for independent development of analytical tools, visualization software, and applications of all types. The Database&rsquo;s broader goal is to encourage and enable data-driven collaborative efforts that address large-scale paleobiological questions.

### Rolling Deck to Repository

* <b>Description:</b> The R2R facility maintains a master catalog of field expeditions (oceanographic cruises) for the US academic research fleet, including those that collect seafloor samples for paleo studies.  Each cruise has a DOI, which is linked to related resources in SESAR, IMLGS, and EarthChem, as well as links to ORCID iDs for investigators.  The full R2R catalog is published as Linked Data.

### System for Earth Sample Registration (SESAR)

* <b>Description:</b> SESAR, the System for Earth Sample Registration, is a web-based registry for samples and related sampling features. SESAR&rsquo;s objective is to promote sharing, linking, and integration of sample-based data through unambiguous identification of samples. SESAR is an Allocating Agent for the International Geo Sample Number (IGSN, see above); catalogs and preserves sample metadata profiles; and provides access to the sample catalog via a Global Sample Search. SESAR is operated by the Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance (IEDA, see above).

### VertNet

* <b>Description:</b> VertNet is a NSF-funded collaborative project that makes biodiversity data free and available on the web. VertNet is a tool designed to help people discover, capture, and publish biodiversity data. It is also the core of a collaboration between hundreds of biocollections that contribute biodiversity data and work together to improve it. VertNet is an engine for training current and future professionals to use and build upon best practices in data quality, curation, research, and data publishing. Yet, VertNet is still the aggregate of all of the information that it mobilizes.
