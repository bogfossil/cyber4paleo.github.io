<h1>Geoscientific Resources<</h1>

Please see this <a href=http://bit.ly/1r4AqLN>EarthCube Tools presentation</a>, which provides an overview of many resources, some of which will be relevant to the C4P Community Development Workshop.

<h2>Continental Scientific Drilling Coordination Office (CSDCO)</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Description:</b> The CSDCO provides infrastructure for scientists utilizing core samples from Earth&rsquo;s continents in their research, through integrated support for coring and drilling projects, from project inception through curation.</li>
	<li>URL: <a>http://csdco.org</a></li>

<h2>DarwinCore</h2><ul>
	<li><b>Description:</b> The Darwin Core is body of standards that facilitate the sharing of information about biological diversity by providing reference definitions, examples, and commentaries. The Darwin Core is primarily based on taxa, their occurrence in nature as documented by observations, specimens, samples, and related information.</li>

<h2>Flyover Country</h2><ul>
	<li><b>Description:</b> Exposes EarthCube resources on mobile devices for offline use in outreach and soon research purposes. Flyover Country&trade; is a National Science Foundation funded offline mobile app for geoscience outreach and data discovery. The app exposes interactive geologic maps from Macrostrat.org, fossil localities from Neotomadb.org and Paleobiodb.org, core sample localities from LacCore.org, Wikipedia articles, offline base maps, and the user&rsquo;s current GPS determined location, altitude, speed, and heading. The app analyzes a given flight path and caches relevant map data and points of interest (POI), and displays these data during the flight, without in flight wifi. By downloading only the data relevant to a particular flightpath, cache sizes remain reasonable, allowing for a robust experience without an internet connection.</li>

Its purpose is to provide global, collection-based occurrence and taxonomic data for organisms of all geological ages, as well data services to allow easy access to data for independent development of analytical tools, visualization software, and applications of all types. The Database&rsquo;s broader goal is to encourage and enable data-driven collaborative efforts that address large-scale paleobiological questions.</li>
