title: Code of Conduct
concept: Code of conduct for participation at the hackathon (as opposed to repositories).

This CDW Code of Conduct has been modified from the [“Hackathon Code of Conduct”](http://hackcodeofconduct.org/) and reflects the values and intent of the Organizing Committee.

# Briefly
The Cyber4Paleo Community Development Workshop [CDW] is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, previous attendance or computing experience (or lack of any of the aforementioned). We do not tolerate harassment of CDW participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at the venue, during break-outs, talks, workshops, parties, social media and in CDW related online media. CDW participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the workshop without a refund (if applicable) at the discretion of the organisers.

# The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Photography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
As the CDW is oriented toward the development of new applications it is important to note that any tools developed at the workshop are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.

Sponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of CDW Organizing Committee immediately.

CDW Organizers will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.

CDW Organizers may take any action they deem appropriate if a participant engages in harassing behavior. This includes warning the offender, expulsion from the CDW with no refund (if applicable), or reporting their behaviour to local law enforcement.

We expect participants to follow these rules at hackathon and workshop venues and hackathon-related social events.

This policy has been agreed upon by by the CDW Organizers:
