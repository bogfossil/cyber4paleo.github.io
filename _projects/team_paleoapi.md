# Paleo API

We are going to parse the output of the PaleoBioDB / Neotoma Composite Data API to 

- identify duplicate occurrence records present in both databases. 
- attempt to create reliable time translation table between different time keeping formats
- make inferences on how best to identifiy and manage duplicate data for future import efforts
