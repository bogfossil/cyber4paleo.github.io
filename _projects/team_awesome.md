# Project Goal

We are focused on building an application to make the allied C4P resources as amazing as possible.  Using C++, XML and a SQL database we will develop a tool that uses an interconnected technical framework to increase the connectivity of coupled linkages between conjoined resources, in an effort to improve the secure pathways between resources and heighten the overall awesomeness of interrelated paleo-geo-biological resources.
