*Working to bring the CSIRO geologic time RDF resources into several data holdings


# Team Members

  * Douglas Fils  -- Consortium for Ocean Leadership
  * Bob Arko -- SESAR
  * Alexandra Noronha -- University of Texas  
  * Anders Noren -- CSDCO 
  * Shannon Peters -- Macrostract


# Project Goal

To take the resources from https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/wiki/CGIModel/GeologicTime
and use them to add properties to geologic time resources, like data files across
several group.   Simon Cox has noted that if we can get interest in these he
would spend some time to update the latest ICS timescales and also 
OWL time http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/isotc211/iso19108/2002/temporal

# Questions

  * How to "age" the CSDCO data:  Neotoma age models, Geo Deep Dive possible
  * Connect CSIRO/ICS and Macrostrat concepts ID's via GeoLink Graph


# Links

  * SESAR GeoLink RDF for time
  * Macrotrat relations
  * CSIRO   https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/wiki/CGIModel/GeologicTime
